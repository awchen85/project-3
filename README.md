  ## Description
  OurPlace was developed to be a roommate finder for people that can not cover rent and need a way to vet potential roommates. Step aside CraigsList. Users register with their first name, last name, email, and password. Once registered the user can comb through the home page and look for potential roommate candidates. On this home page, cards are generated on a component gathering the users profile data: username, gender, budget, location, allow pets, and about me. These profile cards are generated on each users dashboard. If the user wants their own data on the site they go to their dashboard page and fill out the profile form. This form creates and updates the users profile and will now be seen on the home page. The homepage has a filter for all available profile inputs other than username and about me. This filter gives each user the ability to find the perfect match for themselves. This application also has a working friend mutation, so users will be able to add friends and in the future send direct messages to them.

  ## Usage
  Register yourself with valid information and a password with 7 characters including: lower/upper case letters, one number, and one special character. Go to your dashboard in the navigation bar at the top. Fully fill out the dashboard profile form on your dashboard page, which will create your own profile card to be searched for. Go back to the homepage and use the filter to fine tune your results to what best suits your needs.
